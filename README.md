# Mastermind_game
This Python script implements a simple 4-digit guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides an interactive console interface, prompting users to enter their guesses while offering feedback on the number of correct digits in the correct positions. Players can terminate the game at any point by typing "exit" or "quit." If they guess the number correctly, the game congratulates them and displays the total number of attempts taken. The program features robust input handling and clear instructions, enhancing user experience while maintaining a straightforward gameplay loop.
